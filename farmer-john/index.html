    <h2>Farmer John</h2>
    <p class="home-text">
        Farmer John is getting too old and achy to be working on his farm all day everyday.
        He wanted to hire some farmworkers, but we convinced him that our team could build
        an AI agent that could easily help him on his farm and for much cheaper than
        conventional labor. Farmer John wants us to make an AI agent that can plant and
        harvest wheat, carrots, and potatoes for him. This means we will need to teach our
        AI farmer to navigate around Farmer John’s farm and how to best maintain the farm
        in order to guarantee the highest possible crop yield.
